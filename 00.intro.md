# Quick Facts
## TS Disappears at run time
- Sometimes I would find myself expecting typescript to know that something wouldnâ€™t work and not create an error case for it
- The instructor kept repeating this throughout the course and it really helped me think about typescript in the right way


## Global File Types Discouraged
- define types as close to where they are used and import them
- informs reader of where the type is coming from
- preserve name space
